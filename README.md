# TwitterAnalysis
Tweepy based twiiter stream collection based on a keywords (manchester united, real madrid and barcelona in this case) and analysis of the output using matplotlib.
In this case the analysis was based on the criteria that which team is popular based on the number of tweets each team received in a given time frame.
Barcelona appeared to be the most popular team by numbers :p
